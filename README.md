# Battleship
## Description
* The game is played on for grids, two for each player. The grids are typically square - usually 10x10 - and the individual squares in the grid are identified by letter and number.
* On one grid the player arranges ships and records the shots by the opponent. On the other grid, the player records their own shots.
* Before play begins, each player secretly arranges their ships on their primary grid.
* Each ship occupies a number of consecutive squares on the grid, arranged either horizontally or vertically.
* The number of squares for each ship is determined by the type of ship.
* The ships cannot overlap(i.e., only one ship can occupy any given square in the grid).
* The types and numbers of ships allowed are the same for each player. 
* The ships should be hidden from players sight and it's not allowed to see each other's pieces.
* The game is a discovery game which players need to discover their opponents ship positions.
